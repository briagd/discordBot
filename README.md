# A simple discord bot
Using discord.py
Get memes and jokes using the reddit api
Get the weather using the open weather api <br>

The bot will greet anyone that says "hi" or "hello" on any channel

Type any of the following tags to interact with the bot:<br>
!meme : to get a programming meme <br>
!joke : to get a joke<br>
!weather : to get today's weather in Belval, Luxembourg<br>
!retrieval : add a question after this tag related to the information retrieval and you will get a crappy answer as I was only trained using few wikipedias articles<br>
