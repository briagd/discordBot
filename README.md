# A simple discord bot
Using discord.py
Get memes and jokes using the reddit api
Get the weather using the open weather api <br>

The bot will greet anyone that says "hi" or "hello" on any channel

Type any of the following tags to interact with me:
!meme : to get a programming meme 
!joke : to get a joke
!weather : to get today's weather in Belval, Luxembourg
!retrieval : add a question after this tag related to the information retrieval and you will get a crappy answer as I was only trained using few wikipedias articles
